# machine-learning

# Code is for Machine learning challenge which deals with Multi-Label classification proble by building a classifier for it. The data used for training is a tsv file with 2 columns : tags and job descriptions. Current algorithm maps new job description given to list of tags which we have trained the model with. For future enhancements, the listing of tags will happen in order of imporatance calculated using algorithm to check the file for number of occurences of tag words.
